# A multi-center multi-subject human neuroimaging dataset to study dementia- BioFIND
# BioFind data paper

The BioFIND data set contains a multi-center multi-subject resting state Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
and structural T1-wighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data which acquired from two sites in Cambridge and Madrid.
As a simple way to standardize, organize and share pooled data from the both sites,
we standardized the data set to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format.
The dataset in BIDS format includes all information about conditions, data formats,
applied software filters, recording details, participant characteristics, etc.
The dataset is freely available from https://biofind-archive.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/

This repository contains all MATLAB codes and scripts including preprocessing, source-localisation, feature-extraction and machine learning codes 
to reproduce results and analysis of BioFIND data paper.

To run the scripts succesfully, it needs to have an updated OSL (https://ohba-analysis.github.io/osl-docs/) and
consequently SPM (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) be installed on your PC.

Work in progress
